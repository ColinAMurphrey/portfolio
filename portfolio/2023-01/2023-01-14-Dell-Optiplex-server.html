            <h1>Dell Optiplex Server</h1>

            <p>
                Recently, I was able to acquire a Dell Optiplex from work so I can use it for projects.
                My IT department began recycling hardware they didn't need anymore.
                Naturally, given that I do a lot of projects with homemade servers, I asked about a Dell Optiplex that they seem to have forgotten about.
                My boss agreed to letting me have it.
                He gave me an empty SSD that I could install whatever operating system I wanted to onto it.
